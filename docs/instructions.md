# To test the mock api server try out these commands:

- Under the **root directory** on your terminal run:

``` docker-compose up ```

```prism mock everyshilling.yml``` -

- In either a new terminal or your browser test out your endpoint.

```curl http://127.0.0.1:4010/currencies ```

# N/B: Possible errors Docker compose might generate errors...if the everyshillingyml file is not placed under the root folder.

# test-api.yaml file to be deleted once all the endpoints are included in the everyshilling,yml
